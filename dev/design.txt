Approach:
- It's hard to plan everything now, perhaps I should just get started on a quick draft, and then throw out the parts that don't work well.
- Probably need a compiler
  - Also use Angular processing?
  - Use any template language?
- Should the document source be a valid-ish document? Display in any way correctly?
- Should users ever need javascript?
- Figures will not be positioned automatically, is that a good thing?
- Come up with a name
-


Ingredients:
- Citations
- References
- Equations (mathjax)
- Images
- Printable
- Compiler
- Single-file flag
- Local vs cdn flag
- (Online editor)
- Add-on manager
- Includes (split files)
- Fonts, Kerning etc
- Client features (print, search, index, notes...)
- Paged vs flow
- Themes (styles & templates)
- graphs (d3, c3)
- Index/ToC
- // Comments


Considerations:
- What about figure/equation/table numbering? CSS can do numbering but no references, so do this in code.
    Including 'only number referenced figures'? And ofc. make clickable links.
- I should list latex complaints to make sure they're actually solved.
- Make all references (fig ref, footnote, citation) clickable/hoverable to reveal the full target so you never have to search.
- Should citations still use tex? http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/11516/alternatives-to-bibtex2html (add hrefs though, this is the 21st century)?
    A custom templating engine would work quite well for bibliography.
- Should self-contained version of document with multiple chapters be a SPA?
    It's pretty much the only way; should there be url updates and everything?
- addons installed in addons/name/v1.0 where 1.0.2 is expected to be just bugfixes for 1.0.1 (and so the latest 1.0.* is always used)
    They're hosted on a server anyway so might as well use that as a cdn.
- Security warning about blindly pasting documents on your website.
- How do themes (book template, crimson style) relate to display modes (print version, paged vs flow, ..)
    Also night mode, contrast mode, ...
- Remember document position using url hash as well as cookie
- What to do with versions? Have compiler & addon versions, with the option of using old ones?
    It'll still look different in different browsers though
- Might be good to create a few javascript events:

- Should there be pdf versions? Or is printable & standalone enough?
- Include source in output by default? Sensitive comments...
- How can modules e.g. replace tags? There must be a compiler hook somewhere
- Add (Iced)CoffeeScript and Stylus (& sass etc?) support
