Status:
- Configuration can't be in the source file, since loader, pre-processor and parser are all needed to get to the settings (arguments are also convenient).
- I'll have to switch to a configuration file instead (can be shared by multiple documents? and should be extensible, e.g. inherit a parent).
- Try to keep all the configuration straight: packages, projects and user config; project can extend user config; command line can extend both; I think all 3 should have a fixed list of allowed options.
- UPDATE: no, it really seems like a bad idea to keep requirements in a separate file, it's like linking requirements on the command line in Fortran, rather than at the top of each file like Python
- So: loader can be a flag, since it's more system dependent than document dependent; for the parser I might require all of them to be xml-subsets so that I can be guaranteed to always be able to load with xml just to get config
- Should each file have it's own requirements? And be parsed independent of modules loaded by other files? Perhaps can add global option to top-level requirements, and an independent feature to add 'inherit-parent-requirements' tag in any child.
- ^ Does that mean I need a post-merge compile step? E.g. for figure numbers. => That's usually called linking, so yeah I need that

How important is setting a specific compiler version?
A: not at all: output looks different in different browsers anyway, why not different html?
B: should be available for corner-cases: you can install an older version of compiler through pip
C: important: should be available as compiler flag and/or document property (so cannot be tied to pip version)
*: Maybe the compiler should also be a package, those things already have parallel versions. Have the compiler build the command line arguments too then?

And I probably want logic in input files like if and loop, even if only for 20% of cases. Perhaps use Jinja. Should that also be a package?


Approach:
- Realize that the main difference between tex and notex is that content is free-flowing
- It's hard to plan everything now, perhaps I should just get started on a quick draft, and then throw out the parts that don't work well.
- Probably need a compiler
  - Also use Angular processing?
  - Use any template language?
- Should the document source be a valid-ish document? Display in any way correctly?
- Should users ever need javascript?
- Figures, tables etc will not be positioned automatically, is that a good thing?
- Page breaking, adding footnotes, etc will be difficult
- Come up with a name
- Should everything be <xml>-like or {%different%}? Consider: markup vs proc. language? html parser vs independent language?
- Compiler itself should be an app, so that you can have multiple installed in parallel (pip package can't do that)

Ingredients core:
- Compiler
- Includes (split files)
- Paged vs flow
- Themes (styles & templates)
- graphs (d3, c3)
- Index/ToC
- Variables
- Review mode
- // /* Comments */
Ingredients in separate apps:
- Add-on manager
- Fonts, Kerning etc
- Documentation & examples
- Style guide warnings
Ingredients in addons:
- Citations
- References (id, #)
- Equations (mathjax)
- Images
- Printable
- Default style (readability research)
Ingredients probably in addons:
- Single-file flag
- Local vs cdn flag
- Optimize flag
Maybe never:
- Online editor
- Demo website for packages(themes)
- Hosting for documents?


Considerations:
- Use multiprocessing only if compiling is typically slower than serialization (maybe time and cache this).
- Should be able to integrate with memcached or something... Or maybe just a simple Python module?
- ^This would be a compiler flag module, not one set in the document; how are those handled? PIP or package manager.
- If I want footnotes etc visible on mouseover, then it should happen at compile-time and not with css
- Require a kind of doctype (which could also hold the version?), to distinguish notex input from normal html (output or otherwise).
- Make a tool that recompiles on page refresh to show the latest version
- Easily make internal links to (sub)chapters
- Split notex cmd into commands? Like django does? (Runserver, migrate,...). Necessary for notexpm, maybe not for compiler, or do it later...
- package compiler to class
- jinja package
- make usable by assistive technology like screen readers
- command to create a document outline of some rype (letter, article, etc). Maybe let packages define empty document templates?
- Maybe google pagespeed can be an app for notex
- Perhaps package order as the only control over compile order is insufficient, it's very critical.
- Package(s) to convert common LaTeX \commands to html
- Package(s) to convert common mistakes http://line25.com/articles/10-html-entity-crimes-you-really-shouldnt-commit
- $\gamma$ for variables and in equations, γ in text or names [isn't this kind of annoying? maybe γ work in mathjax?]
  Google recommends against using entities except the ones that have special html meaning like <>&
- Mathjax at compile time or in client? It's pretty slow (so compile) but behaves differently in different browsers (so client)
- Should people use <article>, <section>? Or should they use <chapter> which I then convert? Or use just headers and add articles automatically?
- Use JS strict mode, but not for entire files https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode
- What about figure/equation/table numbering? CSS can do numbering but no references, so do this in code.
    Including 'only number referenced figures'? And ofc. make clickable links.
- I should list latex complaints to make sure they're actually solved.
- Make all references (fig ref, footnote, citation) clickable/hoverable to reveal the full target so you never have to search.
- Should citations still use tex? http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/11516/alternatives-to-bibtex2html (add hrefs though, this is the 21st century)?
    A custom templating engine would work quite well for bibliography.
- Should self-contained version of document with multiple chapters be a SPA?
    It's pretty much the only way; should there be url updates and everything?
- addons installed in addons/name/v1.0 where 1.0.2 is expected to be just bugfixes for 1.0.1 (and so the latest 1.0.* is always used)
    They're hosted on a server anyway so might as well use that as a cdn.
- Security warning about blindly pasting documents on your website.
- How do themes (book template, crimson style) relate to display modes (print version, paged vs flow, ..)
    Also night mode, contrast mode, ...
- Remember document position using url hash as well as cookie
- What to do with versions? Have compiler & addon versions, with the option of using old ones?
    It'll still look different in different browsers though
- Might be good to create a few javascript events:
    http://www.kirupa.com/html5/custom_events_js.htm
- Should there be pdf versions? Or is printable & standalone enough?
- Include source in output by default? Sensitive comments...
- How can modules e.g. replace tags? There must be a compiler hook somewhere
- Recommended to split packages into small subpackages (using the main one just to require others), so that tags can be individually turned off. Or use options I guess.
- Soup compiler only, people can easily add Angular directives by themselves (even through the compiler)
- Make a few good example documents (article, letter, CV ...) so people can 1) see how to structure such a document 2) find examples of specific tag usage
- PGF/TikZ support? (convert to svg perhaps, but seems not trivial)
- Make a document compile flag that outputs the settings to get suitable images for MPL, Matlab, etc. (font-type and -size, img width, maybe even colors).
- Package for color coding of code
- Maybe also a package for running code (pass a lot of context)
- Do I need some kind of AJAX handlers?
- Add timing for each app for each step
