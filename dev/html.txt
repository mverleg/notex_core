- I'm probably going to NOT omit all the tags that aren't required, contrary to Google's recommendation. Size isn't that important.

- It's not entirely clear what html5 best practices are, there are many style guides but I've not found an automatic style checker tool (especially: which tags can be omitted or left unclosed?)

- Add (Iced)CoffeeScript and Stylus (& sass etc?) support
- Use <aside> for things that can be removed without reducing the meaning of main content

- Maybe the outliner should be in javascript, for future live updates? Doesn't seem like there's a Python version anyway

- Note that no browsers use the sectioning information, but it's still quite suitable for notex with a little css etc, e.g. for easy ToC
