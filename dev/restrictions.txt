- Alternative parsers must parse subsets of xml, that is, any input must also be parse-able by an xml parser.
  Furthermore, parsing behaviour of requirements and settings must not require any special parsing
    These requirements are needed because an XML-parse is done first to get these settings,
    before re-parsing with any chosen special parser (although caching might make this step unnecessary sometimes).

- Pre-processors may not change requirement, include or settings statements
    This requirement is needed because these are loaded without pre-processing initially.
    However, they may be loaded with pre-processing due to cache, which must not make a difference!
