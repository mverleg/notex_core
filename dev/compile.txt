arguments I
FOR document:
	pre-process I (defaults or cached)
	parse I (defaults or cached)
	get modules & settings
	arguments II
	IF pre-processing or parsing is different:
		  pre-process II (completely redo)
		  parse II (complete redo, ignore requirements)
      include >>
      tags
      substitutions
linking
external files
rendering
post-process

!!! See documentation graph for the compiler layout


------------------

Perhaps somehow rendered tags could be cached based on the arguments they receive
These arguments shouldn't be huge objects like 'request' then, or they should be immnutable so they can be hashed once per compile

#todo: cache should be nuked if packages change
