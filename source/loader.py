# todo: package loading, for optimal control of order and versions, should proceed as: go over the direct requirements and add those to a list, then in that order one by one, recursively insert the package's dependency before the actual package, unless it was seen before, in which case you go back and update the versions range. This way the correct recursive structure is obtained, but with option for overruling order from the main file. Should main file package versions also overrule later ones? Probably so, but maybe recommend against using it needlessly, as using below-requirement versions quite likely causes trouble. Add a command to list all packages in said order, and another to list only the explicitly specified packages. It seemd the package manager will not have installation, it just installs missing packages during document compilation. Don't make a complicated system for keeping track of which packages are old; it's easy enough to just nuke the directory and things will be redownloaded when needed. Is that acceptable behaviour? If people don't lile it they can manually uninstall stuff (uninstall command). Have an rc file which contains the package servers (multiple possible) and the install directory. Add commands that can be run independent from whatever project you're working on.
