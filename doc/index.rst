NoTeX
=================================

NoTeX is (will be) a program for compiling code-line input files into document.
Kind of like LaTeX, except not terrible and outdated.
The name NoTeX is just temporary, it will get a final name eventually (without "tex" probably, also "notex" is already in use).
