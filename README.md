Notex
=============================

This project aimed to create a document specification format which has the same aims as LaTeX, but different implementation. Some design goals:

* Based on familiar tools (html, css)
* More geared towards modern media (web, interactive)
* Faster and simpler compilation than LaTeX
* Less historical baggage
* Designed for extensibility
* Separation of content and style, but with easily editable style

*It is currently on hold or perhaps discontinued*.
